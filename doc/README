Compatibility to MUD Map 1
MUD Map 2 uses an improved version of the file format of MUD Map 1. It
can read worlds that were created with MUD Map 1 and saves them in a
compatible format if compatibility is enabled (should be enabled by 
default) Note that MUD Map 1 might be updated to use the same file
format after version 1.4

Keyboard commands
Keyboard commands can be used to navigate and alter the map if keyboard
place selection is enabled by pressing p. A red box should be visible on
the screen. You might have to click at the map once after you opened it
for it to be able to receive keyboard events.

The keys used here are not final and might not be optimal. Please let me
know if you think that other keys should be used ;)

context menu key				show the context menu of the selected
								place (like right click on that place)

+/- 		page up/down		increment and decrement the tile size
p:								enable / disable place selection

w/a/s/d 	arrow keys			shift the selection
e 			insert key			create / edit place at selection
f								create or remove a placeholder place
r 			delete key			remove selected place
q								modify area of selected place. Note that
								this also affects other places that
								belong to the same area. If no place is
								selected or selection is disabled, a new
								area will be created
