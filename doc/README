Compatibility to MUD Map 1
MUD Map 2 uses an improved version of the file format of MUD Map 1. It
can read worlds that were created with MUD Map 1 and saves them in a
compatible format if compatibility is enabled (should be enabled by 
default) Note that MUD Map 1 might be updated to use the same file
format after version 1.4

Keyboard commands
keyboard commands can be used to navigate and alter the map if keyboard
place selection is enabled (a red box should be visible on the screen)

+/-:		increment and decrement the tile size
p:			enable / disable place selection

w/a/s/d: 	shift the selection
e:			edit / create place at selection
r:			remove selected place
