## Bugs and problems
If you encounter any bugs or other problems please contact me or write a bug report on GitHub [https://github.com/Neop/mudmap2/issues](https://github.com/Neop/mudmap2/issues) so I can fix it.

## Installation
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE, Version 7 or newer) needs to be installed on your computer. [You can get it here.](https://www.java.com/de/download/index.jsp)

Put mudmap.jar or mudmap-2.X.X.jar wherever you like. Most systems should start it by a double click. If it doesn't try a right click, select "open with" or similiar, then select "Java JRE" (depending on your operating system.

Another option is to start it from command line / shell by calling "java -jar mudmap.jar". Use this to get for more detailed information in case errors occur.

## Portable mode
When you start MUD Map for the first time you will be asked whether you'd like to use MUD Map in portable mode. In this case the world files will be stored in the same directory as the mudmap2.jar.

If you don't use portable mode, you can find the files here:

Linux: ~/.mudmap/

Windows: %appdata%\mudmap\

## Compatibility to MUD Map v1
MUD Map v2 can read and write world files created by MUD Map v1. This is not recommended though since some flaws in the old file format can cause data loss, also some new features are not supported.
